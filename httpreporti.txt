HTTP is an extensible protocol .HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client. There are two types of messages: requests sent by the client to trigger an
action on the server, and responses, the answer from the server.The client-server structure, combined with the ability to simply add headers, allows HTTP to advance along with the extended
capabilities of the Web.It allows the browser and the user to communicate with different sources on the Internet.For this reason the browser identifies and locates the resources and the bits of info are described by a URI .

The target of an HTTP request is called a resource, whose nature isn't defined further,it can be a document,
a photo, or anything else. Each resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier used throughout HTTP for identifying resources.The HTTP Messages transmitted during 
requests or responses have a very clear structure.In Data URLS,URLs prefixed with the data scheme, allow content creators to embed small files inline in documents. 

A media type is one that indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes.There are two class types. Discrete types are types which represent a 
single file or medium, such as a single text or music file, or a single video. A multipart type is one which represents a document that's comprised of multiple component 
parts.
